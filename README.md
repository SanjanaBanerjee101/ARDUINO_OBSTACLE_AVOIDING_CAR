🚗 Arduino Obstacle Avoiding Car

This project demonstrates an **autonomous obstacle-avoiding and maze-solving car** built using an **Arduino Uno**, motor driver shield, ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor.  
The robot detects obstacles in its path, makes intelligent decisions to move forward, stop, or turn left/right, and is capable of navigating through a maze environment.

## ⚙️ Features
- Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection.  
- Servo-controlled sensor scanning for left/right pathfinding.  
- Smooth speed ramp-up for motors to protect batteries.  
- Autonomous movement with decision-making (forward, stop, reverse, turn).
